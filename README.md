### Movies App
## Description
This project is a movie search application built using the MovieDB API. The initial phase focuses on fetching and displaying a list of movies based on the keyword "return" without implementing search functionality yet.

## Important Note:
The API server might be blocked for some users in Russia. If you encounter registration issues, we recommend using a VPN (e.g., Zen Mate for Chrome or AD Guard with 3GB free monthly traffic). Remember to disable the VPN after development to restore internet speed.
