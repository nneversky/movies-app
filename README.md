Movies App: Film Search with React and Ant Design

This is a modern web application for movie search, built with React 19 using Create React App as its foundation. The interface is developed with Ant Design (AntD) components, while film data is fetched from The MovieDB API.

The Rated tab stores user-rated films in local storage for quick access

Implementation highlights:

Fully responsive design that displays correctly on mobile devices, tablets, and desktops thanks to AntD's flexible layout system

Hybrid architecture combining class components with lifecycle methods and functional components for rendering

Utilization of Lodash for data optimization and debounced search implementation

Clean and intuitive interface with smooth transitions

Configured code quality control system with ESLint, Prettier, and pre-commit hooks via Husky

The project demonstrates a classic React development approach without hooks, making it an excellent example for studying component lifecycle methods. The combination of modern UI design with traditional React patterns provides valuable insights into different architectural approaches.

The application serves as a practical implementation of:

API integration with real-world movie database

State management without hooks

Responsive design principles

Code quality best practices

Efficient data handling techniques

Built with performance and user experience in mind, this project showcases how to create a production-ready application using established React patterns while maintaining code quality through modern development tools.
